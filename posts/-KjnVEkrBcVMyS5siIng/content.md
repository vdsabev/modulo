### Why
IoT devices are generating an increasing amount of data every year. A single autonomous car can output 100 TB **every second**, and supporting this kind of bandwidth is expensive and prone to failures, or at the very least - latency. If your car had to wait for a server somewhere to respond every time you want to overtake another vehicle, that would eventually result in an accident.

### How
A simple way to reduce costs and increase reliability is to avoid sending data to the cloud in the first place and process it locally instead.

### What
Azure Edge is a powerful solution to that exact problem. It allows packaging the services you would typically run in the Azure Cloud into a self-sufficient container, which can then be deployed to anything, be it an IoT device, an industrial machine, or just a regular laptop PC.

### Demo
This demo specifically concerns workplace safety. By integrating computer vision and machine learning, Microsoft has created a service that allows companies to monitor the workplace, create policies and rules, and manage employee roles and access:

### Other applications
Since computer vision and machine learning have improved significantly in the past few years, it's now possible to create complex monitoring systems. While Microsoft's solution is meant to be for the workplace specifically, Big Brother-style government surveillance now looks even easier to implement in terms of technology.

If such a security system is ever proposed publicly or even accepted, transparency will be crucial. People will want to know who accesses their data, or even to be able to opt out completely. And while we have an easier time accepting being monitored at our workplace right now, people would have an entirely different attitude towards applying this technology for policing and surveillance.
