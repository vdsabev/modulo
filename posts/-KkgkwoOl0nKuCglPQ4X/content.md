### Why
Mixed and virtual reality is the future of computing, and all major tech companies are investing a lot into the sector. Consumer adoption will strongly depend on how accessible, comfortable, and socially appropriate the devices will be. Right now, headsets are relatively bulky and inconvenient to use.

### How
If headsets look more familiar and their weight is massively reduced, consumers are more likely to invest in a pair.

### What
Microsoft Research has further reduced the hardware necessary for displaying holographic images to be very similar to regular glasses. By having the bulk of the processing power in an external device, consumers can have a more natural experience with mixed reality.
