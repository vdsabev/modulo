### Why
2.7 million Americans have atrial fibrillation (AF) - a kind of heart arrhythmia which can lead to a stroke, but doesn't typically show any symptoms.

### How
Quick detection of AF could help doctors prevent further complications and save lives.

### What
Health startup Cardiogram and the UCSF Health lab presented their study on detecting AF at the Heart Rhythm Society's 38th Annual Scientific Sessions.

A procedure called _cardioversion_ can restore a patient's heart rhythm after an arrhythmia. 6,158 people enrolled in the Cardiogram Apple Watch app, providing precious data for the study, and 51 of them undertook the procedure. The patients used an Apple Watch alongside a 12-lead ECG before and after the _cardioversion_, and so served as a control group.

Using the collected data, researchers trained a deep neural network that managed to diagnose heart arrhythmia with 97% accuracy.
